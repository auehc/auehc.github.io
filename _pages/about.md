# Who We Are

Auburn University Ethical Hacking Club (AUEHC) is a child organization of Auburn's Associate for Computing Machinery (ACM). AUEHC is a cybersecurity student organization founded in January 2016 by Jeramy Lochner and Matt Rogers. 

## Objective

AUEHC’s primary objective is to build interest in cybersecurity within Auburn University’s student body. Our members are composed of freshmen to graduate students, each with an interest in different parts of the cybersecurity field.
AUEHC is focused on developing a new wave of cybersecurity professionals.

## Accomplishments

Over the past 4 years, we have taught Auburn University students cybersecurity principles through our participation in international security competitions, lectures on security topics, and practice with industry-standard security tools.

In the 4 years we have been active, we have worked with national laboratories to hold cybersecurity events, contributed to educating the general population about computer hygiene through good works, and developed and hosted a public cybersecurity event, [AUCTF 2020](href:ctf.auburn.edu), with over 2000 participants from all around the globe.
