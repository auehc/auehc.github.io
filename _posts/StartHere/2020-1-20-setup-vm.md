 * What is a Virtual Machine?
    * A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system. Software called a hypervisor separates the machineâ€™s resources from the hardware and distributes them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.

# VirtualBox Installation

  1. For this demonstration we are going to use VirtualBox. You can start by navigating to its main page [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then select the appropriate download according what operating system you are currently running on your machine. For this example, we are using a Macbook so select the MacOS install.
