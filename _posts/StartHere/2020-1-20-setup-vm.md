 * What is a Virtual Machine?
    * A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system. Software called a hypervisor separates the machineâ€™s resources from the hardware and distributes them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.

# VirtualBox Installation
<ol>

   <li>For this demonstration we are going to use VirtualBox. You can start by navigating to its main page <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">here</a> and then select the appropriate download according what operating system you are currently running on your machine. For this example, we are using a MacBook so select the MacOS install. </li> <br>

   <li> Once the downloader has installed, go ahead and run the installer to  the VirutalBox application on your machine. </li> <br>

   <li> After installing your VirtualBox machine, we will next download our Kali Linux image to put on our new VirtualBox application. Depending on your machine, download either the 32 or 64-bit image. The download for this Kali Linux image can be found [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) </li> <br>

   <li> Our next step is to open up our VirtualBox application and then select the 'New' icon to setup and new virtual OS. </li> <br>

   <li> You will then be prompted to enter in a name for your VM image. In this case we choose to call it 'Kali Linux'. Be sure to select Type: Linux and Version: Debian (64-bit) from the drop down menu. Once completed, click the Continue button. </li> <br>

   <li> From here, VirtualBox will ask you for how much RAM you would like to allocate. You can select the default amount (1024MB or 1GB) of RAM but we recommend 2000MB or 2GB of RAM as this will make your virtual machine run faster. After this step, click Continue. </li> <br>

   <li> Next, you will be prompted to create a virtual hard disk for your VM. Select the 'Create a virtual hard disk now' option and then click Create. </li> <br>

   <li> We recommend that the size of your VM be at least 20.00GB in length, but you can customize this to your own needs. Once done, click Create. </li> <br>
