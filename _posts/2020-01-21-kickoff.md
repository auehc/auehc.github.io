## What we do

This semester we will have more events than ever before!
We will be participating in monthly CTFs again this semester.
The first CTF will be NeverLAN CTF which is going to be the first weekend of February. After that we will be participating in TAMU CTF in March and then in April we will be having our own CTF.

We will also be funding three students to go to DEFCON again this year.
Last years trip was a success and we were one of the first groups to solve last years badge!

We will also be participating in a Attack / Defend exercise hosted by NATO in March.
This will be completely new to us as we have never participated in this type of event before. 

This year we will also be giving lectures of ComptTIA's Security+ Certification.
It is an entry level cybersecurity certification so anyone who comes to the lectures and studies on there own should be able to pass.
We will be funding ten students to take the test for free!

During Auburn Hacks 2020 we will also be making an appearance.
A "mini" CTF will be hosted during the hackathon.
Each category will get an alloted time and we will be there to discuss the category and how to do the challenges.
Winners of each categories can win various prizes!
