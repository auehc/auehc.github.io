This week Matthew went over our plan for the semester and the EVAPI exploitation process
EVAPI stands for Enumeration, Vuln Scanning, Access, Privilege Escalation, and Implant

As our main focus is hacking consumer IoT devices, we will be light on enumeration, and focus mostly on getting Access.
For some practice with binary exploitation / reversing, the flare-on challenge is a good resource.
