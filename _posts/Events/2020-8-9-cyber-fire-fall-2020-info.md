## What are Cyber Fire Puzzles?
Cyber Fire Puzzles are beginner-friendly cyber security challenges created by the U.S. Department of Energy and Los Alamos National
Laboratory. The challenges cover a variety of cyber security topics and offer participants the opportunity to learn more about the field.

## Can I work with a team?
Participants are encouraged to work in teams of roughly 6 members of equal skill level; however, participants can work alone if they would prefer. If you donâ€™t have a team, we can help you find one in the [AUEHC discord](https://discord.gg/Bs6CUNh). Cyber Fire Puzzles offers a greatopportunity to gain experience working on cyber security problems and looks good on your resume and to employers.
