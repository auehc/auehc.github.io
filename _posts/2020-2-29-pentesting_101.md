## What is Pentesting?
According to *Wikipedia*, penetration testing (pentesting) is:
> an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to
> evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify
> both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the
> potential for unauthorized partied to gain access to the system's
> features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment
> to be completed.

## Pentesting has levels
In the world of penetration testing, there are three different classes of
assessment, all based on the amount of information given to the pentesting
team.
* Black Box - in a black box pentest, the red team is given no information
  about the company/system that they are testing. This type of assessment
  takes the longest amount of time, is the most expensive, and most
  accurately simulates an outside threat.
* White/Clear Box - in a white box pentest, the red team is given lots of
  information about the company/system. This type of assessment is the
  cheapest, usually takes the least amount of time, and closely simulates
  an insider threat. 
* Gray Box - somewhere between black and white box tests.

## Pentest vs Vulnerability Assessment
The main difference between a pentest and vulnerability assessment is if
the tester uses the vectors found in the vulnerability assessment to
simulate an attack on the system. Vulnerability assessments' goal is to
enumerate a company/system's vulnerabilities, whereas a pentest is to 
enumerate the vulnerabilities and to see how deep the wound could get.

## Are there steps to follow?
In penetration testing there are a few standards or frameworks that can
be followed to ensure that the red team is effectively executing within
their given time frame. One popular standard is the Penetration Testing
Execution Standard (PTES) and it breaks down a penetration test into six
steps, which a red team can follow to ensure that they are effectively
managing their time on an assessment. Those steps are:
* Tools Required
* Intelligence Gathering
* Vulnerability Analysis
* Exploitation
* Post Exploitation (Pivot, Persistence, etc.)
* Reporting
