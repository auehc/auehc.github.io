## Southeast Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Preliminaries (SEC CDC)

SEC CDC is a regional event that is apart of a larger national event. 
If we rank in the top 8 across all teams we will be able to participate in the regionals.
From there we can move onto the national event.

CDC is a attack defense styled competition where we take on the role of the blue team.
Meaning we have a certain number of boxes we need to secure before the red team breaks into them.
